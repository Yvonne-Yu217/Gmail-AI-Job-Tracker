# Job Application Tracker

An enhanced job application tracking system that automatically extracts and analyzes job application data from Gmail using AI.

## Based On

This project is based on [zichengalexzhao/job-app-tracker](https://github.com/zichengalexzhao/job-app-tracker) with practical improvements:
Attribution: the original idea and foundation come from the repository above. This project focuses on practical enhancements and operational tweaks, with clear credit and link back.

## Changes Summary
- Enhanced email classification, especially for nuanced declines
- Flexible model support (default cost‑efficient model, configurable by user)
- Real-time pipeline output with per-step summaries
- Progress bar in email processing for visibility
- Simplified visuals (status distribution chart)
- Safer defaults and .gitignore for credentials/data

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Gmail account
- OpenAI API key

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-app-tracker.git
cd job-app-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

#### 1) Gmail API Setup (OAuth Desktop App)
- Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create/select a project.
- Enable the Gmail API:
  - APIs & Services → Library → search “Gmail API” → Enable.
- Configure OAuth consent screen:
  - OAuth consent screen → External → fill basic info (App name, support email) → Add test users (your Gmail) → Save.
- Create OAuth client credentials:
  - APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID → Application type: Desktop app.
  - Download the JSON and save it to `config/gmail_credentials.json`.

Notes
- Do NOT commit `config/gmail_credentials.json` or `config/token.json`. They are ignored via `.gitignore`.
- On first run, a browser window will open for Google login & consent; a token is stored at `config/token.json` for subsequent runs.
- Scopes are limited to Gmail read-only for safety.

Verify
```bash
python job-app-tracker/main.py --limit 1
```
You should be prompted to authenticate on first run.

#### 2) OpenAI API Setup
- Create an API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Put it into an environment file:
```bash
mkdir -p config
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > config/.env
```

Optional
- You can also set or override model via env, e.g. `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini`.
- The `.env` file is loaded at runtime and is git-ignored.

Quick Test
```bash
python job-app-tracker/generate_stats.py
python job-app-tracker/create_visualizations.py
```

## Usage

### Complete Pipeline (Recommended)
```bash
python job-app-tracker/pipeline.py
```
This runs everything: data reset → email extraction → deduplication → export → statistics → visualization

### Individual Components
```bash
# Extract emails only (all emails)
python job-app-tracker/main.py

# Extract emails from specific date range
python job-app-tracker/main.py --since 2024-01-01 --until 2024-12-31

# Extract emails from last N days
python job-app-tracker/main.py --days 30

# Extract with limit
python job-app-tracker/main.py --limit 100

# Clean duplicates
python job-app-tracker/clean_duplicates.py

# Generate stats
python job-app-tracker/generate_stats.py

# Export to CSV
python job-app-tracker/print_table.py --output data/applications.csv
```

## Output Files
- `data/job_applications.json` - Clean job application data
- `data/job_applications.csv` - CSV export
- `data/processed_ids.json` - Processed email IDs tracking
- `visualizations/status_distribution.html` - Status distribution pie chart

## Features
- Smart email filtering (excludes job alerts, includes applications/interviews/offers/rejections)
- AI-powered extraction of company, position, status, location, date
- Automatic duplicate detection and merging
- Cost-efficient OpenAI usage
- Interactive HTML visualizations

## Troubleshooting
- **Gmail auth issues**: Delete `config/token.json` to re-authenticate
- **OpenAI errors**: Check API key in `config/.env` and account credits
- **No emails found**: Ensure you have job-related emails in Gmail inbox
